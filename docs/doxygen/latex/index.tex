This is a very much work in progress collection of stuff to aid with the \href{https://ncot.uk/agon-light-c-development/}{\texttt{ Agon Light C Compiler}} that runs under Linux and so on. It is likely to get updated randomly as I do further development and decide things need to be in here.

It uses \href{https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html}{\texttt{ Semantic Versioning}}\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysection{Requirements}\label{index_autotoc_md1}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item You\textquotesingle{}ll need the \href{https://github.com/pcawte/AgDev}{\texttt{ AGDev}} C compiler already installed and working before this will be any use.
\item The \href{https://github.com/tomm/fab-agon-emulator}{\texttt{ fab-\/agon}} emulator will also be useful.
\item The \char`\"{}\+Tools\char`\"{} folder contains useful utilities.
\item Doxygen generated documentation can be generated, and exists in the docs/doxygen folder.
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysection{What to do next}\label{index_autotoc_md2}

\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Clone this repo and strip out all the Git stuff from it, you\textquotesingle{}ll want to make a new Git repo for whatever you\textquotesingle{}re working on.
\item Look at the Makefile and edit as needed -\/ mostly to set paths and so on, and to see what it does
\item Your code goes in \char`\"{}src/main\+\_\+src\char`\"{}, data can go in \char`\"{}data/\char`\"{}
\item You will need to edit \mbox{\hyperlink{main_8c}{main.\+c}}, see the comments in there
\item Look at the documentation inside {\ttfamily docs/} if you point a browser at {\ttfamily docs/doxygen/html/index.\+html} you can read it all.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

I am working on a wizard type tool to copy and set up a new project from this to reduce the amount of effort.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md3}{}\doxysection{When programming}\label{index_autotoc_md3}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Running {\ttfamily make} will compile things, this should work out the box if you set it up correctly and is a good test.
\item Running {\ttfamily make emulate} will also copy the relevant code into the fake SD card and start the emulator, you will need to copy any resources yourself. It will also edit/create an autoexe.\+txt file in the fake SD card folder so your code starts immediately. Copy the autoexec.\+txt first if you\textquotesingle{}ve customised it.
\item Running {\ttfamily make inst\+\_\+sd} will copy everything onto the SD card if you mounted it properly.
\end{DoxyItemize}

If something doesn\textquotesingle{}t make sense, raise an issue. I hate poorly documented code and am putting in effort to make this code have better than average documentation! I\textquotesingle{}ve learnt that if I document it, I can also read the docs and don\textquotesingle{}t need to remember what everything does! Fancy that... documentation can be useful. Spread the word ;-\/)
