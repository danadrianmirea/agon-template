RGB2222 format images

Save them as whatever then use imagemagick to convert to png

convert blah.png -posterize 4 output.png

Then run them through the png2rgb.py tool which will output a picture format of my own making which consists of

Header: 10 bytes

NCOTB - magic string meaning RGB2222 bitmap image
WIDTH - 16 bit little endian
HEIGHT - 16 bit little endian
BPP - 1 byte

Pixel Data: Rest of file

1 byte per pixel, RGBA 2 bits each

To use this, read the first 10 bytes, check it starts with "NCOTB".
Then use the width * height * bpp to know the size of the image data in bytes.
